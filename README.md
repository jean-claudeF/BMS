# BMS
The aim of this project is to elaborate a battery mangement system based on a Raspi Pico controller

Git page: https://github.com/jean-claudeF/BMS

A first step to this is a 12 channel voltmeter, to measure the cell voltages (of a 12 cell battery):

The first tests are run on a dummy battery:

This is work in progress and not ready yet!

The Raspi Pico needs some public libraries:
